# Fake News Detection

A machine learning project to classify news as real or fake using Python, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning algorithms.

## Project Overview

This project uses a dataset of news articles to train a classifier that distinguishes between real and fake news. We preprocess the text, vectorize it with TF-IDF, and train a model using a Passive-Aggressive Classifier to achieve accurate classification.

## Dataset

The dataset (`news.csv`) includes columns for the news text and a label indicating if the news is real or fake.
